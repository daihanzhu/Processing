CODING QUALITY AND DESIGN

Througout this course, I have gained so much more knowledge and skills in coding 
that I feel very comfortable expanding to other areas. In this assignmnet, I combined
together many things I've learned and utilized it in my code, and built upon it 
from what I've learned. I feel that my coding style have been more perfected throughtout
the term, and I can block my code better as well, so it can be understood better by me 
and others alike.

The part i'm most pround of is figure out the ways I can layer the different effects onto
other parts of the code, for example, some part of it slows down, and its intentional as it's
part of the idea of the game. I think overall it is very simple idea and design, but the
organizations of the code is well done in my opinion.
